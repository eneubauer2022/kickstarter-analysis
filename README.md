# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to understand if a fundraising theatre campaign's launch date and initial goal amount had a direct impact on the success or failure of that campaign. We gauged the success of the campaign is the amount of pledged donations met a threshold to deem it successful. If we could pinpoint those trends, could we use that data to recommend more successful campaigns in the future and avoid failed and/ or canceled campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the Data in the line graph provided, there are certain months that produce more successful Theater campaigns than other months. I deciphered this data by adding the number of successful, failed and canceled Theatre campaigns into a pivot. All of outcomes were organized by month. I then created the bar graph below to visualize the data and make it easier to interpret. Please refer to the Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launches image. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I created the attached line graph to show the correlation between the outcome of the campaign and the goal of the pledge. I extracted the data from the dataset by using formulas based on certain conditions based on the outcome and goal amount. From those numbers, I was able to calculate the percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns in the buckets we had created based on initial goal amount. The percentage is of the outcomes and the buckets of the goal amounts are represented below with a line graph to show their correlation. Please refer to the Outcomes_vs_Goals image.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
This analysis required some advanced formulas within Excel. If a user was unfamiliar with these formulas that could cause some frustration in gather and splicing the data necessary. If is important for the user to use the formula bar in Excel to walk through formulas they may not be familiar with. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
There are several conclusions we can make from this data. One conclusion that stands out is that theatre campaigns launched in May had the highest number of success rates. This would indicated, that this a great time to launch a campaign for it to be successful. Theatre Campaigns with a launch date in December had almost as many "failed" campaigns as they did "successful" campaigns. The data shows us that this is not an optimal time to launch a successful theatre campaign. Both pieces of data can help us determine in the future, when is the best time to launch a successful theater campaign. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Reviewing the Outcomes based on Goals data - there seems to be some sweet spots of amounts that tend to produce more successful campaigns - if the campaigns have a goal of under $20,000 they tend to be more successful, but also campaigns with goals of $35,000 - $50,000 have a strong success rate as well. If the goal amount of the campaign is $20,000 - $35,000 - we can assume there is more of a likelihood that the campaign may not get the pledged amount tit is looking to achieve and may ultimately fail. The least success rate from our Outcomes data seems to be campaigns at the highest tier - with a goal amount over $50,000. They have the worst success rate and may not be as achievable as other campaigns. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A campaign may have other factors that play into its success or failure - other than what is contained within the data provided. It would help improve the data if we could see more specifics into who was running certain campaigns - is there a person or a group that runs more successful campaigns rather than others? We would also want to know if there are certain incentives offered during successful campaigns that are not offered during campaigns that do not gander enough pledged donations. Are there certain incentives that work better in a subcategory of campaigns that do not work in other campaigns. These are all additional pieces of information we could use to improve this data set for more insight on these campaigns.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Other possible visualizations we could look into are the frequencies of certain subcategories. Are there certain categories that are running more frequently than others? Does that improve or negate the success of a campaign? We may also want to see a graph of the correlations between number of backers and the success of a campaign. It would also be interesting to view the number of  successful campaigns that were a "Staff Pick" - to see if that promotes a success or not. We could present that data in a bar graph of the number of successful vs failed vs canceled - bifurcated by the Staffed Picked to see how the data plays out.
